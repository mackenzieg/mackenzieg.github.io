## Summary

The mmWave radar vital sign detection project explores using millimeter-wave radar technology to remotely monitor vital signs like heart rate and breathing rate. By analyzing the reflected radar signals from a person's chest movements, we can extract these important physiological parameters without any physical contact.

### Key Features:
- Non-contact vital sign monitoring
- Real-time heart rate detection
- Respiratory rate measurement
- Signal processing using auto-correlation techniques## Summary


### Benefits:
- Contact-free monitoring ideal for:
  - Sleep studies
  - Long-term patient monitoring
  - COVID-safe vital sign screening
  - Remote health monitoring

The system demonstrates the potential of mmWave radar technology in healthcare applications, offering a promising alternative to traditional contact-based vital sign monitoring methods.
